# SYXthDimension
Examine DX7 patches through dimension reduction (unsupervised learning)

There are so many DX7 patches available!  The notebook SYXthDimension.ipynb is aimed at grouping patches for the purpose of
* identifying identical (or nearly identical) patches, and
* exploring changes between similar patches.
